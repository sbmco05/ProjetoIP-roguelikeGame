# ProjetoIP-roguelikeGame
The project involves developing a Roguelike game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The game is turn-based, where the hero moves and interacts with enemies and objects across different rooms, progressing toward the final objective.

The game includes:
 - Movement and combat: The hero and enemies take turns performing actions, each with unique behaviors and stats.
 - Inventory and items: The hero can collect and use objects such as swords, potions, and keys.
 - Room system: The player navigates interconnected rooms, facing various challenges and enemies.
 - Scoring and progression: A ranking system keeps track of the top scores.
The implementation follows OOP principles, leveraging inheritance, interfaces, and modularization. This project was developed during the 2022/23 academic year at ISCTE, as part of the Object-Oriented Programming course, in collaboration with a course colleague.
